## ✨ Sentium SDK ✨

Sentium introduces a revolutionary blockchain development framework that addresses fundamental limitations of existing distributed ledger technologies through three groundbreaking innovations: the **Sentium 7-Layer Architecture (SLA)**, **Proof-of-Value (PoV) consensus mechanism**, and **polyglot runtime architecture**. Unlike traditional blockchain platforms, Sentium provides a modular SDK enabling developers to build application-specific blockchains with quantum-resistant security, AI-mediated consensus, and multi-language support.

This technical whitepaper presents the mathematical foundations, cryptographic protocols, and system architecture of Sentium as a blockchain development framework demonstrating theoretical throughput capabilities exceeding 1,000,000 transactions per second while maintaining Byzantine fault tolerance and 256-bit post-quantum security guarantees. Our novel Proof-of-Value consensus mechanism replaces traditional stake-based selection with multi-dimensional contribution evaluation, achieving deterministic finality in 0.5 seconds with energy efficiency improvements of 99.9% over Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work.

The Sentium 7-Layer Architecture (SLA) provides the blockchain industry's first comprehensive layered reference model, analogous to the OSI Model for networking. This architecture introduces two revolutionary layers: the **Intent Layer** (Layer 6) for natural language transaction processing, and the **Bridge Layer** (Layer 3) for native cross-chain communication. Combined with our polyglot runtime supporting Rust, Go, Python, C/C++, and TypeScript, Sentium establishes a new paradigm for blockchain development.
